Hi. Iâ€™m Robert, known online as ylee. I'm a software engineer who is very active in the [Bodhi Linux](https://www.bodhilinux.com/) Community. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving Moksha, fixing broken e17 modules, the Bodhi Linux 7.0 release, some programming tutorials, and more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always trying to learning more about EFL, and whatever other programming topic interest me or seems necessary for Bodhi development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on documentation for [Terminology](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-terminology.md), [Moksha](http://www.bodhilinux.com/moksha-desktop/), and [EFL](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/api/c/start) programming.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything Bodhi Linux related, esp developers, graphic artists and translators.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything Bodhi related, my mathemtaical interests, or programming in general.
- ðŸ›  My favorite language is Python although I do alot of programming in C. I know variable amounts of various other languages naturally.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is public, and I am in the [Bodhi channel](https://discord.com/invite/pvB7MSf) of Discord when online. May or may not be on IRC.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun facts: I am a brick mason, vegetarian, and started programming on punched cards and paper tape.
